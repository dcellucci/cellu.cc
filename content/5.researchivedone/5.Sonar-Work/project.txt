I worked with UGA Sculpture Professor RG Brown, in what he calls his 'artistic research'. Collaborating with researchers in Geology, Geography, and Music, we sought to apply remote sensing technologies to the imaging of submerged or buried sculpture, and produced multiple works that represented these captured datasets as physical forms.
